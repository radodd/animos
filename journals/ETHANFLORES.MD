## 7/13/2023

Planned: In order to resynchronize the front end we will confirm a merge request as a group and continue to build the front end afterwards.



## 7/12/2023

The group broke off to tackle their respective sections on the frontend now that all our endpoints have been completed and pushed to main. I personally still have trouble remembering the git commands and when to push, pull, fetch, etc. The team has been extremely helpful with those commands.

This evening I have created a temporary List Pets frontend. I wanted to ensure I was able to reach into the database and pull data. Tomorrow we will discuss our findings and work on consistency in the frontend.

## 7/11/2023 PET ENDPOINTS

I was assigned to complete all /pets endpoints. After Anthony's help with one endpoint I was able to have the rest of the /pets endpoints done and ready for review by end of day. The team ran into a couple blockers that were both resolved by end of day. One docker issue and another technical bug regarding database changes not correctly updating with no errors.

## 6/29/2023 MONGO DB GROUP DEBUG

I "drove" during the debug session while the rest of the team "navigated". The team make quick work of the error messages and we had MongoDB up and running at 100% in no time. Once we collectively agreed MongoDB was successful I pushed my code to main so the rest of the team were caught up.

## 6/28/2023 MONGO DB SETUP

Experimented with MongoDB tutorial solo and was able to successful run the database on docker and had localhost:8081 render on the browser. Decided to report to the group the following day with my progress and suggest a group debug session in order to complete the entire DB set up.
